How do we account for bias within historical or even relatively current data-sets?  With a history of segregation, red-lining, and predatory loans how would we account for historical bias in a seemly innocuous data-point such as a ZIP or Area Code?  Is it even possible?

Is it data set, data-set, or dataset??

Does my employer have the same definition of "social responsibility" that I do?

Can I verb a noun in Hindi?!
